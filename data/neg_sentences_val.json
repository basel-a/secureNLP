attacked by an unknown group of cybercriminals .", "223": "In all these attacks , a similar modus operandi was used .", "224": "According to victims and the law enforcement agencies ( LEAs ) involved in the investigation , this could result in cumulative losses of up to 1 billion USD .", "225": "The attacks are still active .", "226": "This report provides a technical analysis of these attacks .", "227": "The motivation for the attackers , who are making use of techniques commonly seen in Advanced Persistent Threats ( APTs ) , appears to be financial gain as opposed to espionage .", "228": "An analysis of the campaign has revealed that the initial infections were achieved using spear phishing emails that appeared to be legitimate banking communications , with Microsoft Word 97 \u2013 2003 ( .doc ) and Control Panel Applet ( .CPL ) files attached .", "229": "We believe that the attackers also redirected to exploit kits website traffic that related to financial activity .", "230": "The email attachments exploit vulnerabilities in Microsoft Office 2003 , 2007 and 2010 ( CVE-2012 - 0158 and CVE-2013 - 3906 ) and Microsoft Word ( CVE-2014- 1761 ) .", "231": "Once the vulnerability is successfully exploited , the shellcode decrypts and executes the backdoor known as Carbanak .", "232": "Once access is achieved , attackers perform a manual reconnaissance of the victim 's networks .", "233": "Based on the results of this operation , the attackers use different lateral movement tools in order to get access to the critical systems in the victim s infrastructure .", "234": "Notably , some of the latest versions of the analyzed Carbanak malware appear not to use any Carberp source code .", "235": "Once the attackers successfully compromise the victim s network , the primary internal destinations are money processing services , Automated Teller Machines ( ATM ) and financial accounts .", "236": "In some cases , the attackers used the Society for Worldwide Interbank Financial Telecommunication ( SWIFT ) network to transfer money to their accounts .", "237": "In others , Oracle databases were manipulated to open payment or debit card accounts at the same bank or to transfer money between accounts using the online banking system .", "238": "The ATM network was also used to dispense cash from certain ATMs at certain times where money mules were ready to collect it .", "239": "Please note that the attackers abused the aforementioned services by impersonating legitimate local users who had the permissions to perform the actions later reproduced by the cybercriminals .", "240": "As far as we know , none of the aforementioned services were attacked nor was any specific vulnerability within them exploited .", "241": "Of the 100 banking entities impacted at the time of writing this report , at least half have suffered financial losses , with most of the victims located in Russia , USA , Germany , China and Ukraine .", "242": "The magnitude of the losses is significant .", "243": "For example , one victim lost approximately $ 7.3 million ( USD ) due to ATM fraud ; another suffered a $ 10 million ( USD ) loss due to the exploitation of its online banking platform .", "244": "Stolen funds were transferred out of the affected countries to bank accounts in the US and China .", "245": "Additionally some of the C2 servers have log entries indicating connections to systems located in the US .", "246": "Telemetry indicates that the attackers are expanding operations to other regions , such as Asia , the Middle - East , Africa and Europe .", "247": "This report discusses the attack vectors , infection mechanisms and toolkits used by the attackers to exploit the network after the initial infection , as well as the operational details and geographical distribution of this campaign .", "248": "During the spring of 2014 , Kaspersky Lab was involved in a forensic analysis of ATMs dispensing cash to people located near them but with no physical interaction according to security cameras .", "249": "No malware was detected on these ATMs .", "250": "However , Carberp - like malware was found on a computer that was connected to them via VPN .", "251": "Following the investigation of this incident , in the summer of 2014 , Kaspersky Lab identified the same Carberp - like malware in another investigation involving a bank , where criminals were able to gain access to its online banking systems .", "252": "In this investigation , we started analyzing all the computers in the bank 's infrastructure in order to find the source of the infection .", "253": "We found spear phishing emails with CPL files attached that , after a successful infection , install the same Carberp - like malware we had previously found in the case involving the ATMs .", "254": "There is evidence indicating that in most cases the network was compromised for between two to four months , and that many hundreds of computers within a single victim organization may have been infected .", "255": "This period of time was used by the attackers to get access to the right victims and critical systems , and to learn how to operate their tools and systems to get the cash out .", "256": "Carbanak contains an espionage component that allows the attackers to take control of video capabilities on the victim systems .", "257": "Thanks to this , long term observation and reconnaissance could be conducted .", "258": "This allowed the attackers to understand the protocols and daily operational tempo of their targets .", "259": "Based on this understanding , exploitation methodologies and mechanisms were developed and tailored to each victim .", "260": "All observed cases used spear phishing emails with Microsoft Word 97 \u2013 2003 ( .doc ) files attached or CPL files .", "261": "The doc files exploit both Microsoft Office ( CVE- 2012 - 0158 and CVE-2013 - 3906 ) and Microsoft Word ( CVE- 2014 - 1761 ) .", "262": "There are indicators that point to a possible Chinese origin for the exploits used in these attachments .", "263": "Command and Control ( C2 ) servers located in China have been identified in this campaign .", "264": "In addition , registration information for some of the domains use details of supposedly Chinese citizens .", "265": "Obviously , all this could just be a red herring .", "266": "6 The targets were all employees affiliated to the affected institution .", "267": "The spear phishing email messages appeared legitimate and in some cases were sent from compromised coworkers accounts .", "268": "In this way compromised systems were used as a transmission vector .", "269": "Given that the victims were mostly Russian - speaking financial institutions , the names of the attachments we have identified were generally in Russian .", "270": "Examples include \" \u0421\u043e\u043e\u0442\u0432\u0435\u0442\u0441\u0442\u0432\u0438\u0435 \u0424\u0417-115 \" and \"

capabilities .", "283": "The original file created by the exploit payload is then deleted .", "284": "The naming syntax is \" < ServiceName > Sys \" where ServiceName is any existing service randomly chosen , with the first character deleted .", "285": "For example , if the existing service s name is \" aspnet \" and the visible name is \" Asp.net state service \" , the service created by the malware would be \" aspnetSys \" with a visible name of \" Sp.net state service \" .", "286": "If found on the target system , Carbanak will try to exploit a known vulnerability in Windows XP , Windows Server 2003 , Windows Vista , Windows Server 2008 , Windows 7 , Windows 8 , and Windows Server 2012 , CVE-2013 - 3660 , for local privilege escalation .", "287": "We believe this is not

below happen within this process .", "290": "This file includes the names of the processes to be monitored .", "291": "This monitoring is performed by intercepting the ResumeThread call .", "292": "Also , after executing this service , it modifies the executable code in memory in order to establish simultaneous work processes for both remote and local users .", "293": "Modules modified in this process are : termsrv.dll , csrsrv.dll , msgina.dll and winlogon.exe .", "294": "Carbanak is also aware of the IFOBS banking application and can , on command , substitute the details of payment documents in the IFOBS system .", "295": "To communicate with its C2 server , Carbanak uses the HTTP protocol with RC2+Base64 encryption , adding additional characters not included in Base64 .", "296": "It also inserts strings with different extensions ( .gif,.htm , etc . ) at random locations in the HTTP request .", "297": "Example of a typical Carbanak request .", "298": "The commands are compared with a hash table ; if there is a match Carbanak performs the associated action .", "299": "In order to render the malware less suspicious , the latest Carbanak samples are digitally signed .", "300": "Known samples of Carbanak have been uploaded to VirusTotal from the following locations .", "301": "Known exploits that download Carbanak have been uploaded to VirusTotal mostly from Russia .", "302": "According to KSN data , victims are distributed geographically as follows .", "303": "It is also very interesting to see the distribution of Carbanak submissions to VirusTotal .", "304": "This way we can identify periods when the malware came to the attention of potential victims and security researchers , and helps to reveal peaks in the group 's activity .", "305": "Since the beginning of this case , Kaspersky Lab has worked in cooperation with the LEAs investigating it .", "306": "During the investigation LEAs shared with us statistical data from their research that helped us to complete our picture of the campaign .", "307": "The following map shows targets ' IP addresses found in three of Carbanak 's Linux servers at the end of October 2014 .", "308": "Carbanak uses different tools on infected systems , each one with a different purpose .", "309": "There appears to be a preference for the Ammyy Admin remote administration tool for remote control .", "310": "Specifically , the attackers have been detected uploading : Ammyy Admin 3.5 ( f8cd52b70a11a1fb3f29c6f89ff971ec ) as svchost.exe It is believed that the attackers used this remote administration tool because it is commonly whitelisted in the victims ' environments as a result of being used regularly by administrators .", "311": "This indicates that the attackers did not limit themselves to Microsoft Windows environments .", "312": "Logs for these tools indicate that they were accessed from two different IPs , probably used by the attackers , and located in Ukraine and France .", "313": "We have also found traces of many different tools used by the attackers inside the victim s network to gain control of additional systems , such as Metasploit , PsExec or Mimikatz .", "314": "There appear to be four distinct types of C2 servers .", "315": "Server rotation occurs more or less on a biweekly basis .", "316": "For a complete list of identified Carbanak servers please check the regularly updated Carbanak IOC document .", "317": "The current list of IOCs is provided at Appendix 3 in his document .", "318": "Some of these C2 servers are responsible for dropping Ammyy ( configuration and executable files ) , the KLG plugin configuration ( list of processes to monitor ) and the VNC server ( both 32 and 64 bits to be injected in rundll ) .", "319": "In one of the observed servers there was also a Metasploit module .", "320": "Victim systems are catalogued in the servers ' databases .", "321": "The victims belong to a number of different communities , thus simplifying administration .", "322": "In all , 85 different victims belonging to seven communities were found .", "323": "Additionally , the malicious servers contain video files that capture a victim s activity .", "324": "While the videos are stored using a compressed format which provides poor image quality , the selected format minimizes upload bandwith and is of sufficient quality for the attackers to understand the victims ' activities .", "325": "The video file naming conventions used the name of the application in the foreground ( e.g. , Outlook , Cmd , etc . ) and only recorded user activity .", "326": "This helped the attackers to both navigate to files of interest and to discard superfluous files .", "327": "Using the intelligence gained from video and other monitoring techniques , the attackers developed an operational picture of the victim 's workflow , tooling and practices .", "328": "This picture helps the attackers to deploy their malicious operations , for example .", "329": "In general , the attackers demonstrated great versatility , using attack methodologies best suited to a specific victim 's operational methodology .", "330": "However , they seemed to deliberately limit the amount of money stolen per victim to $ 10 million USD .", "331": "This limit may be explained as the maximum amount of money that can be transferred via mule services , or the maximum amount of money that is budgeted in banks for fraud risks in order to minimize the chances of LEAs and the bank s anti - fraud teams from doing a full blown analysis .", "332": "Sensitive bank documents have be found on the servers that were controlling Carbanak .", "333": "They included classified emails , manuals , crypto keys , passwords and so on .", "334": "For example , the file in the above figure has KVC ( key verification codes ) keys that are used by ATMs to check the integrity of the PIN numbers of its users .", "335": "In other cases involving ATMs , the criminals were able to control computers that had access to the internal ATM network .", "336": "If the bank had enabled remote access to ATMs , the criminals started using this access to remotely withdraw cash .", "337": "Criminals used no malware to operate the ATM dispenser ; instead they used standard utilities to control and test ATM equipment .", "338": "Malware targeting the finance industry ( both companies and consumers ) continues to evolve .", "339": "The Carbanak malware used in the on - going campaign described in this report has been very successful in terms of generating revenue .", "340": "Of particular interest are the attack methods , similar to those used in sophisticated cyber - espionage APTs .", "341": "As such , they represent a new and disturbing trend in the cybercrime market of increasing attack sophistication .", "342": "Despite increased awareness of cybercrime within the financial services sector , it appears that spear phishing attacks and old exploits ( for which patches have been disseminated ) remain effective against larger companies .", "343": "Attackers always use this minimal effort approach in order to bypass a victim s defenses .", "344": "Advanced control and fraud detection systems have been used for years by the financial services industry .", "345": "However , these focus on fraudulent transactions within customer accounts .", "346": "The Carbanak attackers bypassed these protections , by for example , using the industry - wide funds transfer ( the SWIFT network ) , updating balances of account holders and using disbursement mechanisms ( the ATM network ) .", "347": "In neither of these cases did the attackers exploit a vulnerability within the service .", "348": "Instead , they studied the victim s internal procedures and pinpointed who they should impersonate locally in order to process fraudulent transactions through the aforementioned services .", "349": "It is clear that the attackers were very familiar with financial services software and networks .", "350": "As part of an automated reconnaissance phase , the Carbanak malware checked victim systems for the presence of specialized and specific banking software .", "351": "Only after the presence of banking systems was confirmed , were victims further exploited .", "352": "To date , attacks against approximately 300 IP addresses around the world have been observed on analyzed C2s .", "353": "It is possible that these attacks were coordinated to maximize returns prior to industry - wide information sharing and the implementation of countermeasures .", "354": "Existing telemetry indicates that the Carbanak attackers are trying to expand operations to other Baltic and Central Europe countries , the Middle East , Asia and Africa .", "355": "Carbanak may be responsible for losses as high as $ 1 billion USD .", "356": "We believe that the Carbanak campaign is a clear indicator of a new era in cybercrime in which criminals use APT techniques directly against the financial industry instead of through its customers .", "357": "APTs are not only for stealing information anymore .", "358": "Decryptor # ! /usr /

facing web servers that have been exploited through vulnerable Content Management Systems ( CMS ) .", "774": "Unlike traditional botnets in which infected hosts connect to control servers for tasking , within FRATERNAL JACKAL 's botnet , nodes are directly tasked by the adversary through multiple layers of infrastructure .", "775": "CrowdStrike Intelligence continued to actively investigate this adversary during 2014 , specifically seeking means by which it propagated its botnet .", "776": "In October , a PHP script was identified in connection with this adversary .", "777": "This script is used for scanning lists of domains by parsing each domain 's robots.txt file to identify any server running the CMS Joomla .", "778": "Domains identified from this script are directly posted to a hard - coded control server , something not seen previously by CrowdStrike with this adversary 's toolkit .", "779": "Normally , performing server reconnaissance by parsing the robots.txt file of a server is a trivial task .", "780": "However , when looked at in the context of this adversary 's strategic operations , it suggests that the adversary is not only Notable Activity using their first -

by tactics rather than SWC because the sites hosting the code were controlled by the adversary and not compromised legitimate sites .", "799": "The GIFAS - related activity delivered a different malware payload ( Sakula ) than the VFW incident ( ZxShell ) .", "800": "The Sakula payload communicated with an entirely different C2 infrastructure than the ZxShell , oa.ameteksen.com .", "801": "This indicates that a different adversary was responsible for the GIFAS- related SWC operation .", "802": "Further investigation into this activity showed a number of similarities to a 2012 zero - day ( CVE-2012 - 4792 ) SWC campaign that leveraged the website of a U.S .- based manufacturer , Capstone Turbine .", "803": "These similarities were : the use of Sakula malware , GIFAS - based subdomains related to both incidents , and the use of zero - day vulnerabilities .", "804": "At the end of 2014 , CrowdStrike Intelligence also discovered potential links between this adversary and its HURRICANE PANDA adversary ( discussed in more detail below ) ; however , evaluation of these connections is still ongoing .", "805": "CVE-2014 -

escalation tools .", "813": "In fact , some tools were found with exploits for similar vulnerabilities that have been addressed by Microsoft in patches released earlier in 2014 .", "814": "These tools share an overall structure with the new one , indicating that the same code was used to weaponize privilege- escalation exploits for different security bugs .", "815": "These observations suggest that HURRICANE PANDA maintains an arsenal of exploits for unpatched privilege - escalation vulnerabilities .", "816": "two thousand fourteen CrowdStrike Global Threat Intel Report Notable Activity This case underlines the necessity of tight endpoint monitoring in order to detect adversary behavior like this .", "817": "Within days of discovering the use of the exploit , CrowdStrike reported the vulnerability and a proof of concept to Microsoft , which subsequently released security bulletin MS14 -

based adversary known to CrowdStrike as FANCY BEAR also piggybacked on the MH17 disaster , targeting victims with the Sofacy malware dropped alongside a document concerning the cessation of hostilities around the crash site .", "854": "Conflict in Ukraine The conflict in Ukraine has been the motivation for a significant amount of targeted intrusion operations and other malicious cyber activity .", "855": "The conflict was leveraged to conduct operations targeting entities in Ukraine , Russia , and other countries with interests in the region .", "856": "China - based adversaries were active in targeting around this conflict .", "857": "A significant amount of the activity from Chinese actors was related to the MH17 disaster discussed above .", "858": "While other malicious operations related to these events targeted Ukrainian entities , most of the activity from China- based actors appeared to be targeted at Russian organizations .", "859": "Numerous incidents were identified leveraging Russian -

based activity , CrowdStrike Intelligence also identified an interesting set of targeted activity apparently focused on targets within Russia .", "866": "The actor responsible employs a rather complex piece of malware that uses polymorphic DLLs and filenames customized on a per - deployment basis .", "867": "The malware was dropped alongside a wide variety of malicious documents containing exploit code for either CVE-2012 - 0158 or CVE-2014 - 1761 .", "868": "Related decoy documents were both Russian and English language and contained content pertaining to Russia such as the Ukrainian conflict , an advertisement for the sale of a car from the German embassy in Moscow , and an invitation to a Russian university conference on space technology .", "869": "The actor abuses legitimate cloud infrastructure for its C2 .", "870": "Notable Activity High Volume of Southeast Asia Targeting Governments in Southeast Asia and organizations doing business in the region have been popular targets for China - based targeted intrusion operations for years .", "871": "China is generally interested in Southeast Asia because of its proximity and its desire to monitor activity in the region in order to retain a strategic advantage .", "872": "However , during 2014 , China was more specifically motivated to carry out targeted intrusion operations in the region by tensions between it and other Southeast Asian nations , primarily Vietnam and the Philippines , due to disputes over territorial rights in the South China Sea .", "873": "The South China Sea has long been a source of tension between China and other Southeast Asian nations .", "874": "The United Nations ( UN ) attempted to ease these tensions in its 1982 Convention on the Law of the Sea , which granted countries in the region rights to marine and energy resources within a certain range of their coast .", "875": "This was meant to give all countries in the region some claim to vital trade routes and to the vast energy resources believed to exist there .", "876": "China disputes the UN - granted rights and stakes a historical claim to almost the entire South China Sea .", "877": "Tensions really boiled over in May 2014 when a Chinese state - owned energy company placed an oil rig , HD-981 , in Vietnamese territorial waters .", "878": "The rig was deployed close to the Paracel Islands , which are claimed by both China and Vietnam .", "879": "The presence of the rig precipitated continuous clashes between Chinese and Vietnamese vessels , violent protests of Chinese businesses in Vietnam , and elevated tensions between China and other nations in the region such as the Philippines .", "880": "It was during this time in May 2014 when China - based targeted intrusion activity against entities in Southeast Asia increased significantly .", "881": "The uptick was likely due to Chinese interest in monitoring reaction of government and other organizations in the region .", "882": "Numerous adversaries ( primarily GOBLIN PANDA , VIXEN PANDA , LOTUS PANDA , PREDATOR PANDA , and PIRATE PANDA ) and numerous malware variants ( PlugX , Poison Ivy , Mirage , Enfal , and Naikon ) were observed being used in these operations .", "883": "Notable Activity Observed targeting by country - may 2014 Observed targeting by country - june 2014 CrowdStrike Intelligence observed that GOBLIN PANDA and VIXEN PANDA were the adversaries most actively targeting Southeast Asia .", "884": "GOBLIN PANDA activity was heavily weighted towards Vietnamese targets .", "885": "This adversary used multiple malware variants during this period , but over time switched over almost entirely to PlugX malware .", "886": "Based on the decoy documents used in the incidents , it appears that Vietnamese government organizations were a primary target ( although private sector targeting of foreign companies was observed as well ) , as the Notable Activity decoys were often Vietnamese government documents .", "887": "The screenshot below is an example of one of these decoys , with this one related to Vietnam 's Fisheries Protection Department .", "888": "A reference to the HD-981 oil rig can be seen in the first sentence .", "889": "The C2 domain for the malware used in conjunction with this document was dns.dubkill.com .", "890": "In the regional targeting surrounding these events , VIXEN PANDA activity was observed focusing mostly on the Philippines , particularly in the area of defense .", "891": "Pictured below is a decoy document from an incident identified in April .", "892": "The only content is a header marked \" Secret \" with the letterhead for the Philippines Naval Operation Center .", "893": "The malware used in this incident was Mirage , installed using DLL side -

June 2014 , the adversary was focused on experts on Asian and Chinese policy at each affected institution .", "903": "This targeting is consistent with the objectives likely imposed on Chinese intelligence collection during this time in support of global intelligence collection surrounding the ongoing HD-981 incident .", "904": "During mid - June , DEEP PANDA clearly and immediately shifted focus from Asia - related issues to Middle East - related issues .", "905": "This shift coincided with a significant uptick in attacks from the Islamic State of Iraq and Syria ( ISIS ) , particularly an attack on the Baiji oil refinery in Iraq .", "906": "At one institution , the actor focused on a target with expertise in China 's natural resource consumption and energy sourcing requirements .", "907": "Additional targets at this institution included an executive assistant and network engineers and administrators .", "908": "The targeting of an executive assistant would likely provide access to information on high -

target basis , spanning multiple operating systems and mobile platforms .", "1016": "A remarkable feature only seen with some of the well - engineered and mature targeted attack malware is the following : If required , the implant can switch the carrier protocol for its command - and- control channel ranging from HTTP over email to removable media .", "1017": "The latter is specifically suited for target environments that do not have direct network connectivity to a C2 node and instead rely on periodic use of USB removable media to bridge air gaps .", "1018": "In addition , recent incidents involved heavily obfuscated malware including code flow obfuscation , likely another step taken in order to hinder analysis efforts .", "1019": "All of these underline a clear targeted attack mission .", "1020": "< Understand how the evolving capabilities of these advanced adversaries will affect you in 2015 .", "1021": "Looking Forward Predicting what will happen in 2015 is a challenge , as unforeseen events will inevitably occur and new TTPs from adversaries across the motivational spectrum will continue to shape the threat environment .", "1022": "Before exploring what may be coming in 2015 , a brief look back at the predictions for 2014 is in order .", "1023": "Last year , CrowdStrike made a number of predictions about the 2014 threat landscape , many of which came to fruition .", "1024": "Outlook for China -
